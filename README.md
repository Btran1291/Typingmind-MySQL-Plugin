## User Settings Input Guide

### Required Settings for MySQL Connection

- **Plugin Server URL:** The URL where this backend server is hosted (e.g., `https://your-server.com` or `http://localhost:8000`).

- **MySQL Host:** Hostname or IP of your MySQL server (e.g., `localhost`, `db.example.com`).

- **MySQL Database:** Name of the MySQL database to connect to.

- **MySQL Username:** Username with appropriate permissions.

- **MySQL Password:** Password for the MySQL user.

### Tips for Common MySQL Servers

- **AWS Aurora:**  
  - Use the **writer endpoint** for write operations; reader endpoint for read-only queries.  
  - Configure **VPC security groups** to allow connections from the plugin server's IP.  
  - Consider using **IAM authentication** for enhanced security.

- **Other Cloud Providers:**  
  - Ensure firewall rules permit your API server to connect.  
  - Use secure credentials and managed identity services if available.

- **Local MySQL:**  
  - Ensure MySQL is running and accessible via TCP.  
  - Use a user with least privilege necessary.

### Security Considerations

- Limit user privileges.  
- Use strong passwords and rotate them regularly.  
- Use encrypted connections (TLS/SSL) where possible.  
- Restrict API access via authentication (e.g., API keys).
