# TypingMind MySQL Plugin Server ðŸš€

This repository contains the backend server code for TypingMind plugins that enable interaction with MySQL databases. The server is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, providing a dynamic and secure way to query and modify data in any MySQL database by receiving credentials directly in each request.

### **Tips for Common MySQL Servers**

To connect successfully, you often need to configure your MySQL server to accept remote connections from your plugin server. Here are tips for common hosting environments:

#### **For Local MySQL (XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, Docker)**
-   **Hostname:** When connecting from a cloud-deployed server, you **must** use a tunneling service like **Ngrok** or **Cloudflare Tunnel** (see instructions below). The hostname will be the public URL provided by the tunnel service (e.g., `X.tcp.ngrok.io:YYYYY`).
-   **`bind-address`:** By default, MySQL only listens for connections from `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`). To allow connections through a tunnel, you must edit your MySQL configuration file (`my.ini` in XAMPP/WAMP, `my.cnf` in MAMP/Linux) and change `bind-address = 127.0.0.1` to `bind-address = 0.0.0.0`. **Remember to restart the MySQL server after this change.**
-   **Firewall:** Your local computer's firewall (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall) must allow inbound connections on your MySQL port (typically `3306`).

#### **For AWS RDS & Aurora**
-   **Hostname:** Use the **Endpoint** URL provided in your RDS or Aurora cluster dashboard (e.g., `your-db-instance.random-chars.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`).
-   **Security Groups:** This is the most common issue. You must edit the database's **VPC Security Group** and add an **Inbound Rule** to allow traffic on port `3306` from your plugin server's IP address.
    -   If your Render service is on a paid plan with a **Static Outbound IP**, add that IP address to the rule (e.g., `YOUR_RENDER_IP/32`).
    -   If you are on a free plan with dynamic IPs, you may need to allow all traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`), but this is **highly insecure** for production.

#### **For Google Cloud SQL & Azure Database for MySQL**
-   **Hostname:** Use the **Public IP address** or **Connection Name** provided in the Google Cloud or Azure portal.
-   **Firewall Rules:**
    -   In **Google Cloud SQL**, go to "Connections" -> "Networking" and add your Render server's IP address to the **Authorized networks** list.
    -   In **Azure**, go to your database's "Connection security" settings and add a **Firewall rule** to allow your Render server's IP address.
    -   The same advice about static vs. dynamic IPs from the AWS section applies here.

#### **For DigitalOcean Managed Databases**
-   **Hostname:** Use the **Host** provided in your DigitalOcean database cluster's "Connection Details".
-   **Trusted Sources:** This is DigitalOcean's term for IP whitelisting. You must edit the **Trusted Sources** for your database cluster and add the IP address of your Render server.

#### **For Hosting with cPanel / Plesk**
-   **Hostname:** This is often your domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) or a specific database hostname provided by your hosting provider. It is almost never `localhost`.
-   **Remote MySQL:** You must log in to your cPanel/Plesk dashboard and find the **"Remote MySQL"** feature. In this section, you need to add the IP address of your Render server to the list of **Access Hosts**. Using the wildcard `%` is possible but less secure.

#### **For DIY MySQL on a VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)**
-   **Hostname:** The public IP address of your VPS.
-   **`bind-address`:** Similar to the local setup, you must edit your MySQL configuration file (`/etc/mysql/my.cnf` or similar) and set `bind-address = 0.0.0.0` to allow connections from outside the VPS.
-   **Firewall (UFW):** You must configure the server's firewall to allow incoming connections on port 3306. For UFW on Ubuntu, the command is `sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp`.

### **Connecting to Local MySQL Databases from Cloud Deployment (e.g., Render.com)**

**Important Note:** If your FastAPI server is deployed on a cloud service like Render.com, it **cannot directly access** a MySQL database hosted on your local computer or a client's local network. This is because `localhost` or private IP addresses (like `192.168.x.x`) refer to the cloud server itself, not your local machine.

To bridge this gap and allow your cloud-deployed server to connect to a local MySQL database, you need to use a **secure tunneling service**. These services create a public endpoint that forwards traffic to your local machine.

#### **Option A: Using Ngrok**

Ngrok creates a temporary, public URL that tunnels traffic to a port on your local machine.

1.  **On the Local Machine (where MySQL is running):**
    *   **Download Ngrok:** Get the executable from [ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download) and unzip it.
    *   **Start Ngrok Tunnel:** Open a terminal/command prompt in the Ngrok directory and run:
        ```bash
        ./ngrok tcp 3306
        ```
        (Replace `3306` with your MySQL server's actual port if different).
    *   **Copy Forwarding Address:** Ngrok will display a `Forwarding` address like `tcp://X.tcp.ngrok.io:YYYYY`. Copy the entire `X.tcp.ngrok.io:YYYYY` part.
    *   **Keep Ngrok Running:** The terminal window running Ngrok **must remain open** for the tunnel to stay active.
    *   **Firewall:** Ensure your local machine's firewall allows inbound connections on port `3306` (or your MySQL port).

2.  **In TypingMind Plugin Settings:**
    *   **MySQL Host:** Paste the **entire Ngrok forwarding address** you copied (e.g., `X.tcp.ngrok.io:YYYYY`).
    *   **MySQL Database, MySQL Username, MySQL Password:** Use your local MySQL database's actual credentials.

**Caveats:** Ngrok's free tier provides dynamic URLs that change each time the tunnel is restarted. This is suitable for testing but not for stable production use.

#### **Option B: Using Cloudflare Tunnel (for more stable & secure access)**

Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) creates a secure, persistent, outbound-only connection to Cloudflare's network, exposing your local service via a stable hostname.

1.  **On the Local Machine (where MySQL is running):**
    *   **Download `cloudflared`:** Get the executable from [developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation).
    *   **Log in to Cloudflare:** Run `cloudflared login` in your terminal and follow the browser prompts (requires a free Cloudflare account).
    *   **Create a Tunnel:** Run `cloudflared tunnel create <YOUR_TUNNEL_NAME>`.
    *   **Configure DNS (Optional but Recommended):** Route a subdomain to your tunnel (e.g., `db.yourdomain.com`) via your Cloudflare DNS settings, or use the public hostname Cloudflare provides.
    *   **Create Configuration File:** Create a `config.yml` file (e.g., in `~/.cloudflared/`) with your tunnel ID and the service to expose:
        ```yaml
        tunnel: <YOUR_TUNNEL_ID>
        credentials-file: /path/to/your/credentials.json # Path provided by cloudflared create
        ingress:
          - hostname: db.yourdomain.com # Or the public hostname Cloudflare gave you
            service: tcp://localhost:3306 # Your local MySQL port
          - service: http_status:404
        ```
    *   **Run the Tunnel:** Run `cloudflared tunnel run <YOUR_TUNNEL_NAME>` (or configure it as a system service for persistence).
    *   **Firewall:** Ensure your local machine's firewall allows inbound connections on port `3306` (or your MySQL port).

2.  **In TypingMind Plugin Settings:**
    *   **MySQL Host:** Use the **stable hostname** configured in Cloudflare (e.g., `db.yourdomain.com` or the Cloudflare-provided public hostname).
    *   **MySQL Database, MySQL Username, MySQL Password:** Use your local MySQL database's actual credentials.

**Benefits:** Cloudflare Tunnel offers stable URLs, enhanced security (outbound connections only from the client's machine, no inbound firewall holes needed on the router), DDoS protection, and can be run as a persistent service.

## Security Considerations

- Limit user privileges to only necessary permissions for security.  
- Use strong, regularly rotated passwords.  
- Enable encrypted connections (TLS/SSL) where possible.  
- Restrict API access via authentication mechanisms such as API keys or IP whitelisting.
